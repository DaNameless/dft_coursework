|     Your reciprocal lattice and k-lattice belong to different lattice       |
|     classes:                                                                |

|        The reciprocal lattice is body-centered tetragonal,                  |
|        whereas your k-lattice is base-centered monoclinic.                  |
|                                                                             |

|     Tetrahedron method does not include variations of the Fermi             |
|     occupations, so forces and stress will be inaccurate. We suggest        |
|     using a different smearing scheme ISMEAR = 1 or 2 for metals in         |
|     relaxations.                                                            |
