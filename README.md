### Usage

    Clone the repository:
    bash
    Copy

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dft_coursework.git  

    Navigate to the relevant folder (e.g., final/ for project files).

### Dependencies

    Code may require DFT software (e.g., VASP, Gaussian) or Python libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib).

    Refer to individual folders for specific requirements.
